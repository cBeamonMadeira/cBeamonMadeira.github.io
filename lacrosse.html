          <p style="color: white">This image was first created by duplicating the background then renaming it desaturate. Second you go under image, adjustments, and desaturate. By doing this it turned the photo into black and white. The desaturate layer was then copied and renamed "Find Edges + Invert". Then under filter, stylize, and find edges the image has a sketchy look. Then the layer was inveretd by pressing CTRL + i. Then the layer is duplicated and renamed "diffuse". Then under filter, stylize, and diffuse aniosotropic was check off. This setting is used to soften up the image. A new adjustment layer is created and solid color is checked off. Then the color blue was selected. The blending mode was then changed to color. The defuse layer is now selected and a new adjustment layer is created under the mode levels. Now the shawdows and highlights are adjusted. This image represents individual effort.
